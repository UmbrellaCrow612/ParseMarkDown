# Notes

- think–implement–redesign is one that should not be missed

- context free grammars, for parsing
- regular expressions, for lexical analysis

Lex:
- we will not assign any meaning
to the strings; we will just be attempting to classify each string as in the
language or not.


# TODO

- Build out lexer 
- Then build out parser
